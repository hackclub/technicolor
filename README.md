# technicolor ðŸŸ¥ðŸŸ§ðŸŸ¨ðŸŸ©ðŸŸ¦ðŸŸª

My name is Matthew, and I worked for Hack Club HQ between January 2020 and June 2021, as the first gap year student and interim head of clubs. Shortly before I left Hack Club HQ, I wrote a 17,516-word guide to leading the clubs program for [Leo](https://leomcelroy.com/), who stepped into my role. This guide extensively detailed my journey as a club leader, painting a vivid picture of my many failures and eventual success, and pulled back the curtain behind the program at Hack Club HQ.

This guide was never intended to be seen by anyone other than Leo, but it eventually found its way to a few other people who, to my surprise, told me it had a deep impact on them. Now far removed from my previous role at Hack Club, I see that the value of this guide reaches much further than I intendedâ€”so I'm sharing it with the world, as **technicolor**. If you lead a Hack Club, or want to learn more about Hack Club's philosophy, or want to read a Hack Clubber's journey, I think you'll find it a useful & inspiring read.

**I'm sharing technicolor almost exactly as it was initially written**: there are some awkward phrases, some information about Hack Club is outdated, and none of the fat is trimmed. **All names are fake** to protect anonymity unless they work for Hack Club or gave me explicit permission to use their name.
